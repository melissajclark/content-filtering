## About Content-Filtering

Filtering content is a common web design pattern. There's tons of jQuery plugins out there, but I want to set it up on my own. 

I learn best by doing, so this small project is an experiment of the best way to filter content using jquery. 

This project uses HTML & CSS (SCSS) and data-attributes to store the data.

Eventually I want to implement this in custom WordPress themes. I like to get the setup down in HTML before moving to setting up the PHP for WordPress.

## Some Questions & Topics I Need To Figure Out

1. How to setup the jQuery selectors when I may not know what the content is? ie. for a client adding tags / info to works
- Is it better to use data attributes or classes for the relevant classifications?
- How to properly implement this in a custom WordPress theme?
