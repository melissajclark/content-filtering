## About Content-Filtering

I've seen a lot of websites with filterable content and also have a need to implement it on my own client projects. I know there are plugins out there but I want to understand how it works and the different methods available.

I learn best by doing, so this small project is an experiment of the best way to filter content using jquery. 

## Some Questions & Topics I Need To Figure Out

1. How to setup the jQuery selectors when I may not know what the content is? ie. for a client adding tags / info to works
2. Is it better to use data attributes or classes for the relevant classifications?
3. How to properly implement this in a custom WordPress theme?
